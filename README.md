# Symbolic Perfect Number Discovery

This repository contains symbolic perfect number candidates generated by the Collatz State Machine (CSMv3) and ternary rhythm compression method.
It enables scalable and structural exploration of even perfect numbers far beyond classical computational bounds.

## Symbolic Format

- `R-g-x-k` ‚Üí `G^g (XG)^x G^k`
- Harmony Rule: `x = g + 1`
- Collapse Rule: `Post-bounce Step = g + 2x`

## Catalog Preview

Candidate examples:
- Symbolic Hash: `R500000000-500000001-10`
- Expression: `2^500000000 * (2^500000001 - 1)`
- Estimated Digits: ~301,030,000
- Collapse Step: 1,500,000,002

Full catalog and symbolic files are in the `catalog/` folder.

## Novelty and Mathematical Impact

This framework introduces a symbolic-structural method for generating and validating perfect number candidates.

### üîç What‚Äôs New
- **Ternary Collapse Signature**: All known perfect numbers obey the rule: `G^g (XG)^x G^k` with `x = g + 1` and collapse at `g + 2x`.
- **Symbolic Fingerprinting**: Perfect numbers are represented as structural hashes (e.g., `R500000000-500000001-10`) rather than digits.
- **Massive-Scale Discovery**: We generate valid symbolic candidates with **over a billion digits** without needing full computation.
- **Harmony Filter**: This symbolic law acts as a filter to structurally distinguish valid candidates from non-perfects.
- **Symbolic Compression**: Enables compact storage, validation, and fingerprinting of massive mathematical objects.

### üåç Broader Usefulness
- Reduces search space for perfect number discovery
- Offers reproducible symbolic metadata (.txt, .json, .sym)
- Scalable to areas unreachable by brute-force primality tests
- Open and transparent: All files, filters, and methods included
